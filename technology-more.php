                        <p class="xsm">Our team has extensive experience developing enterprise applications that can withstand current and future market.

                        <p>Let's say your business is inventory intensive. Maybe an eCommerce website would be more helpful for you. Customers can come and go and purchase items from you all online with a few easy clicks. This makes it much easier for customers to buy from you. This also allows you to collect more in-depth information on who you’re providing your products too, and lets you keep in better contact with your customers. Deals, promotions, and email can all help a business thrive no matter where your location is. Perhaps have this information in large letters, fun and light typeface so it feels conversational after the click on one of the squares are sent further down the page to the portion of the site that will refer to this. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I understand the SEO value of having separate pages, but it feels clunky when you get redirected to a different page after clicking on of the squares as opposed to a force scroll down the page to more information about that topic. I think if we had different pages explaining a little more about each offering, what we’ve done, how we price, things of that nature, we’ll be set. Timos and I should start working on downloadable PDFs that will go more in depth for serious clients. Maybe we can find a way to work that into the website as well.</p>

                        <p>Mobile applications are essential if you are looking for in-depth user engagement and a stronger connection to your users. If you have a product or service that requires an application to function, then you should view building an app as an investment, not a cost. We have experience building applications that link to various other technologies, as well as function in different languages. Send us an email to get in touch with us about how we can help. </p>

                        <p>Once you have your website in place, you need to make sure that you attract traffic. The best way to do that is through Search Engine Optimization [Possibly hyperlink to another page that describes how SEO works in a little more detail]. Imagine you are a customer trying to buy whatever is that you sell. The customer goes onto Google and searches for what your company does. The higher up on that search page that your business appears, the more sales you will get. Think of this as moving up in the Yellow Pages, except you don’t have to change your name!</p>
