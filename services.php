                                The foundation of Android development is built on Java – both a blessing and a curse for companies looking to create an Android app. Java is the one of the most popular languages, and is often one of the first taught to developers in school. What this translates to is a sea of developers that all claim to understand and be proficient in Java. This volume makes it difficult to differentiate between merely competent and highly talented Android developers. The other complication, and what most companies don’t realize, is that the ability to write Java applications often translates poorly to writing Android apps, for example:
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
                            <ul class="xsm">
                                <li>
                                    Common Java application architecture has no place in the Android 
                                    Framework. Android apps have to be fast – 60fps fast. The days of acceptable laggy interfaces are long gone in the mobile landscape. Getting that type of performance across the ~20,000 android devices in existence isn’t easy and requires an incredibly amount of attention to detail coupled with deep QA resources.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Android apps need to be memory efficient. The early android devices gave 16MB to apps and it’s not uncommon to see devices today that only give 60MB to each individual app to run. If you ask the average Java developer what their last application’s memory footprint is they either will not know or it’ll be far above that.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Android apps need to be able to close and open at any time and at any place in the app. Architecting for that isn’t something a traditional Java developer does day to day and it’s not something he or she will be able to flip on a dime and pick up right away.
                                </li>

                                Why Is Mobile Security Important?
                                Exploitations and security issues hit national news frequently and have significant consequences for the companies involved. This <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/security/data-breach/" target="_blank"><strong>IBM study</strong></a> calculated the average cost of a data leak to be $3.8 million for a company. The security of your app is should be absolutely critical to whoever your mobile partner is. Since opening our doors in 2007, our mobile application developers have worked on numerous projects where any security compromise, small or large, could result in significant loss of revenue, and even life. It’s our prerogative to get your app’s security right from the start. And we do, on every project for every client.

                                When one company came to us with their app, we quickly noticed different development teams implemented the analytics on their existing iOS and Android apps. There was no easy way for them to diagnose the difference in usage patterns between platforms as a result. We put together a report detailing the points of inconsistency, calling out major features of their analytics tool they weren’t utilizing fully. After cleaning up the tagging and adding features such as demographic data collection and download source attribution, their marketing team was able to make much more meaningful and informed business decisions.

Modern web applications use architectures that make them more like their native app counterparts on iOS and Android than apps of the web’s old guard.

                                We take a holistic approach to UX design. Modern Softwares designers work directly alongside our UX strategists, developers, and your team to iterate through new ideas and designs swiftly. On any given day, you can find them out in the field doing ride-alongs with client sales teams, interviewing customers in retail stores or restaurants, or walking factory floors to find ways to design more efficient systems for clients.

                                We become deeply immersed in our clients’ business and take a “roll up our sleeves” approach when it comes to UX design. We work hand-in-hand with our internal developers, and client development teams, to ensure what we design is cost-effective to build. Our collaborative process ensures the designs you take home are beautiful, feasible to engineer, and easy to deploy.

                                We continuously review the mobile design tool and resource marketplaces to give our team access to the industry-leading toolsets which our clients can then leverage. The UX lead on a given project then works closely with the client team to select a toolset and set up a design process that works most effectively for our clients’ organizations.
